*Abstract*

Research into elections and voting patterns shows that citizens can be strategic actors who alter voting intentions and contributing patterns to achieve ends. There is sparse research, however, on how individuals interpret and react to pre-election polls and their uncertainty. This paper presents a survey experiment with a fake horse race poll of a South Sudan run-off election. Respondents (N=250) were randomly assigned to a text-only, text and bar plot, or text and dot plot with margins of error presentation of the poll and then asked to evaluate the probability that the poll winner would win an imminent election. An ordered probit model was used to evaluate the impact of the treatment and pretreatment effects. Statistics education was found to have no effect on poll comprehension, even for those taking the class in the past year. Distrusting polls' predictive power had a negative effect on assigned likelihood, and the bar plot treatment seems to have led respondents to overstate the likelihood of the poll winner winning compared to the control and dot plot. These findings are robust in several model specifications, including a Bayesian approach. These results suggest that even seemingly trivial choices by media-including graphics-play a direct role in how individuals perceive the likelihood of electoral outcomes and thus may influence election dynamics.
